        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
          <li>HTML provides structure for the content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <ls>CSS determines the styles of a webpage in order to make a website visually appealing. CSS can also make a website simpler to use with a polished design and consistent organization.</ls>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file, and is used to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element.</li>
          <li>The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>An External is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <ls>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule.</ls>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
          <li>Here is a link for a Git Commands Cheat Sheet https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf</li>
          <li>GitHub offers a task management tool called GitHub issues, which gives developers and teams an easy way to keep track of key tasks and progress. Think of it as a built-in to-do list right inside our GitHub repository.</li>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. To access Git, we use the command line.
          <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely. Using GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others.</li>
