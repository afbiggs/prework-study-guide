          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically not seen by users, but it contains important information about accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
          <li>HTML provides structure for the content.</li>

          <li>Here is a link for a Git Commands Cheat Sheet https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf</li>
          <li>GitHub offers a task management tool called GitHub issues, which gives developers and teams an easy way to keep track of key tasks and progress. Think of it as a built-in to-do list right inside our GitHub repository.</li>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project. To access Git, we use the command line.
          <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code.</li>
          <li>Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.
          <li>Git is great for tracking changes locally on your own computer.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely. Using GitHub not only allows us to store our code, but also to easily collaborate with others.</li>
